## Common Interview Questions

### Q: "What was the biggest challenge in this project?"
A: "The biggest challenge was handling real-time data efficiently while respecting API rate limits. I solved this by:
1. Implementing a rate limiting decorator
2. Using data chunking for large requests
3. Adding comprehensive error handling
4. Creating progress tracking for long operations"

### Q: "How did you ensure the trading bot was reliable?"
A: "I focused on several key areas:
1. Comprehensive error handling for API calls
2. Validation of all input data
3. Proper risk management in trading logic
4. Extensive backtesting capabilities
5. Real-time monitoring and logging"

### Q: "What would you improve?"
A: "Some potential improvements include:
1. Adding machine learning for pattern recognition
2. Implementing more sophisticated strategies
3. Adding portfolio management features
4. Improving backtesting performance
5. Adding more risk management tools"

### Q: "How does the trading strategy work?"
A: "The strategy combines multiple technical indicators:
1. Trend following using EMAs
2. Momentum analysis with RSI and MACD
3. Volatility measurement with Bollinger Bands
4. Risk management with ATR-based stops
5. Position sizing based on account risk"

## Technical Deep Dives

### Data Processing
```python
def get_historical_data(self, start_date, end_date):
    # Explain: Efficient data fetching with pagination
```

### Strategy Implementation
```python
def check_signals(self, row, prev_row):
    # Explain: Multiple indicator confirmation
```

### Risk Management
```python
risk_amount = balance * 0.01  # 1% risk per trade
position_size = risk_amount / (entry_price - stop_loss)
```
