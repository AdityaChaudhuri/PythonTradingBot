## Technical Indicators

### Moving Averages
1. **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**
   - Gives more weight to recent prices
   - Used in our bot:
     ```python
     df["EMA_5"] = ta.ema(df["close"], length=5)
     df["EMA_8"] = ta.ema(df["close"], length=8)
     df["EMA_20"] = ta.ema(df["close"], length=20)
     df["EMA_50"] = ta.ema(df["close"], length=50)
     ```
   - Trading signals:
     - EMA crossovers
     - Price crossing EMA
     - EMA slope direction

2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
   - Measures momentum (0-100 scale)
   - Calculation:
     ```python
     df["RSI"] = ta.rsi(df["close"], length=14)
     ```
   - Interpretations:
     - Above 70: Overbought
     - Below 30: Oversold
     - Divergence signals

3. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
   - Trend-following momentum indicator
   - Components:
     ```python
     macd = ta.macd(df["close"])
     df["MACD"] = macd["MACD_12_26_9"]
     df["MACD_signal"] = macd["MACDs_12_26_9"]
     df["MACD_hist"] = macd["MACDh_12_26_9"]
     ```
   - Signals:
     - MACD crossing signal line
     - Histogram direction change
     - Divergence patterns

4. **Bollinger Bands**
   - Volatility-based indicator
   - Calculation:
     ```python
     bbands = ta.bbands(df["close"], length=20, std=2)
     df["BB_upper"] = bbands["BBU_20_2.0"]
     df["BB_middle"] = bbands["BBM_20_2.0"]
     df["BB_lower"] = bbands["BBL_20_2.0"]
     ```
   - Usage:
     - Price above upper band: Potentially overbought
     - Price below lower band: Potentially oversold
     - Band squeeze: Volatility contraction
     - Band expansion: Volatility increase

5. **ATR (Average True Range)**
   - Measures market volatility
   - Used for:
     ```python
     df["ATR_14"] = ta.atr(df["high"], df["low"], df["close"], length=14)
     ```
   - Applications:
     - Stop loss placement
     - Position sizing
     - Volatility assessment

## Trading Concepts

### Trend Analysis
1. **Trend Types**
   - Uptrend: Higher highs and higher lows
   - Downtrend: Lower highs and lower lows
   - Sideways: No clear direction

2. **Trend Identification**
   ```python
   trend_up = (row['EMA_20'] > row['EMA_50'] and
              row['close'] > row['EMA_20'])
   ```
   - Multiple timeframe analysis
   - Trend line drawing
   - Support/resistance levels

### Support and Resistance
1. **Support Levels**
   - Price levels where downward movement tends to stop
   - Often previous lows or psychological numbers

2. **Resistance Levels**
   - Price levels where upward movement tends to stop
   - Often previous highs or psychological numbers

3. **Dynamic Levels**
   - Moving averages
   - Bollinger Bands
   - Trend lines

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
1. **Fixed Risk Method**
   ```python
   risk_amount = balance * 0.01  # 1% risk per trade
   position_size = risk_amount / (entry_price - stop_loss)
   ```
   - Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
   - Adjust size based on stop loss distance
   - Consider account balance

2. **Maximum Position Limits**
   ```python
   MAX_POSITION_SIZE = 10000
   MAX_DAILY_TRADES = 10
   RISK_PERCENTAGE = 1
   ```
   - Prevent overleveraging
   - Daily trade limits
   - Total exposure limits

### Stop Loss Strategies
1. **Technical Stop Loss**
   - Below support in uptrend
   - Above resistance in downtrend
   - Outside Bollinger Bands

2. **Volatility-Based Stop Loss**
   ```python
   atr_stop = entry_price - (row['ATR_14'] * 1.5)
   ```
   - Uses ATR for dynamic sizing
   - Adapts to market conditions
   - Prevents premature stopouts

3. **Time-Based Exits**
   - Maximum holding period
   - End of day closing
   - Before major news events

## Trading Strategies

### Multi-Factor Strategy (Used in Bot)
1. **Entry Conditions**
   ```python
   # Trend Confirmation
   trend_up = (row['EMA_20'] > row['EMA_50'] and
              row['close'] > row['EMA_20'])
   
   # Momentum Check
   rsi_bullish = 30 < row['RSI'] < 70
   macd_bullish = (row['MACD_hist'] > 0 and 
                  prev_row['MACD_hist'] < row['MACD_hist'])
   
   # Volatility Check
   bb_bullish = row['close'] > row['BB_middle']
   ```

2. **Exit Conditions**
   - Take profit at R:R ratio
   - Stop loss at technical level
   - Trailing stop implementation

### Strategy Optimization
1. **Backtesting Parameters**
   - Historical data analysis
   - Parameter optimization
   - Performance metrics

2. **Performance Metrics**

   results = {
       'total_trades': len(trades_df),
       'winning_trades': len(trades_df[trades_df['pnl'] > 0]),
       'win_rate': win_rate,
       'profit_factor': profit_factor,
       'total_return': total_return
   }
   ```
