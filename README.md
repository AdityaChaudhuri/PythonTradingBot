# Introduction to Data Analysis

This project is part of Assignment 3 for the subject 31250 â€“ Introduction to Data Analytics at UTS. The task involves building and evaluating machine learning classifiers to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing data. The target variable is "subscribed" (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

The assignment requires implementing at least five classifiers: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. The dataset is preprocessed and models are trained, tuned, and evaluated to determine the best-performing approach. The final predictions are submitted to a private Kaggle competition for assessment.
